# Ping Pong Game ðŸŽ®

A simple and fun single-player Ping Pong game built using Python and the Tkinter library. The objective of the game is to bounce the ball using the paddle and achieve the highest score possible. The game gets more challenging as the ball speed increases with each successful bounce.

## Features
